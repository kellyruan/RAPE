	<h5>This petition strives to raise awareness of sexual assaults on college campuses and compel colleges to take action. Colleges should be responsible 
	for maintaining a safe environment for their students. There are countless incidents of sexual assaults on college campuses remaining unreported or are not 
	taken seriously by the college administration staff. People should feel safe enough to speak up and share their story of violence. You can help change this 
	and turn college campuses into a safer place for everyone. Sign this petition today and let people all over the world know that <br> YOU ARE HERE FOR THEM
	and THEIR VOICE MATTERS!
