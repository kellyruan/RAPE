  <p><h5>Our petition is based on creating awareness about sexual assault and rape in general and on college campuses. We want people to feel safe to open
         and tell their story. Too many cases have happened where people haven't been able to do that. Whether it was because they were scared or they didn't
         feel strong enough. We hope that you sign this petition if you agree with us and want to let people all over the world know that <br> YOU ARE HERE FOR THEM
         and THEIR VOICE MATTERS!
